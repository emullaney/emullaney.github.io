### Erin Mullaney @emullaney
I have a degree in computer science and have developed applications and designed databases for over fourteen years. I develop applications primarily using the following technology stack: Python, Django, jQuery, LESS, HTML5 and CSS3, with a focus on performance and elegant reusable code.

I love what I do and want to use my design and programming skills to make life easier and improve other people's jobs.

### Open-Source Projects I've worked on

#### RapidPro Community Portal

I developed the [Community Portal for RapidPro](https://community.rapidpro.io/) using the Wagtail CMS. I also [wrote about](https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2016/02/15/wagtail-2-steps-adding-pages-outside-cms/) adding pages outside of the CMS. Code can be found at [github/rapidpro-community-portal](https://github.com/rapidpro/rapidpro-community-portal).


#### TracPro: A Hosted Data Visualization Web App for RapidPro
I worked on [TracPro](https://github.com/rapidpro/tracpro), a dashboard add-on, custom designed for UNICEF. The add-on allows country offices to quickly build additional, more complex reports. I worked on updating all time-based charts and maps for the entire site utilizing [HighCharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) and [HighMaps](http://www.highcharts.com/maps) for visualizations. 

#### MDN: Mozilla Developer Network
I've worked on the spam moderation pieces of the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) wiki in order to drastically cut down on the time it takes admins to clear out spam and ban users. Work was forked off of the [Mozilla Kuma repository](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma). The Mozilla team was very [impressed with this project work](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.mdn/phVYeWfRlWc) and extended our contract.
