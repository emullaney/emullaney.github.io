I develop applications primarily using the following technology stack: Python, Django, jQuery, LESS, HTML5 and CSS3, with a focus on performance and elegant re-usable code.\r\n\r\nI love what I do and want to use my design and programming skills to make life easier and improve the world.\r\n\r\n### Open-Source Projects I've worked on\r\n\r\n#### RapidPro Community Portal\r\n\r\nThe [Community Portal for RapidPro](https://community.rapidpro.io/) was built using the Wagtail CMS. I also [wrote about](https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2016/02/15/wagtail-2-steps-adding-pages-outside-cms/) adding pages outside of the CMS. Code can be found at [https://github.com/rapidpro/rapidpro-community-portal](https://github.com/rapidpro/rapidpro-community-portal).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### TracPro: A Hosted Data Visualization Web App for RapidPro\r\nI worked on [TracPro](https://github.com/rapidpro/tracpro), a dashboard add-on, custom designed for UNICEF. The add-on allows country offices to quickly build additional, more complex reports. I worked on updating all time-based charts and maps for the entire site utilizing [HighCharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) and [HighMaps](http://www.highcharts.com/maps) for visualizations. \r\n\r\n#### MDN: Mozilla Developer Network\r\nI've worked on the spam moderation pieces of the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) wiki in order to drastically cut down on the time it takes admins to clear out spam and band users. Work was forked off of the [Mozilla Kuma repository](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma). \r\n\r\n#### Speaking\r\n\r\n##### Past\r\n###### Pycon 2016: Leveraging Text Messaging in 2016 with RapidPro\r\nI submitted and co-presented at this talk in May 2016 at Pycon.\r\n[RapidPro Presentation Description](https://us.pycon.org/2016/schedule/presentation/2265/)\r\n\r\n##### Future\r\n###### PyData Carolinas 2016: Reach More People: SMS Data Collection with RapidPro\r\nWe are presenting the RapidPro talk again, this time with a focus on data collection at the PyData Carolinas conference.\r\n\r\n###### Raleigh Women in Tech Summit 2016: Staying a Woman in Tech \r\nI submitted, organized and am speaking on this panel coming up in October 2016. [Staying a Woman in Tech Panel description](http://womenintechsummit.net/raleigh_session/staying-a-woman-in-tech/). \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Get in Touch\r\nerinwyher@gmail.com",
