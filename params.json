I develop applications primarily using the following technology stack: Python, Django, jQuery, LESS, HTML5 and CSS3, with a focus on performance and elegant reusable code.\r\n\r\nI love what I do and want to use my design and programming skills to make life easier and improve the world.\r\n\r\n### Open-Source Projects I've worked on\r\n\r\n#### RapidPro Community Portal\r\n\r\nI developed the [Community Portal for RapidPro](https://community.rapidpro.io/) using the Wagtail CMS. I also [wrote about](https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2016/02/15/wagtail-2-steps-adding-pages-outside-cms/) adding pages outside of the CMS.

The add-on allows country offices to quickly build additional, more complex reports. I worked on updating all time-based charts and maps for the entire site utilizing [HighCharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) and [HighMaps](http://www.highcharts.com/maps) for visualizations. \r\n\r\n#### MDN: Mozilla Developer Network\r\nI've worked on the spam moderation pieces of the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) wiki in order to drastically cut down on the time it takes admins to clear out spam and ban users. Work was forked off of the [Mozilla Kuma repository](https://github.com/mozilla/kuma). \r\n\r\n#### Speaking\r\n\r\n###### RapidCon 2016: TracPro - How it Works & What It Does\r\nThis was be a technical deep dive into the features of TracPro which is a dashboard add-on to RapidPro which we custom designed for UNICEF at Caktus. RapidCon is a small invite-only conference for RapidPro developers hosted by UNICEF. I gave this talk in November 2016 at the second annual RapidCon.\r\n\r\n###### Raleigh Women in Tech Summit 2016: Staying a Woman in Tech \r\nI submitted, organized and spoke on this panel on October 1, 2016.
